# FastAPI Quote Manager

A simple quote management application built with FastAPI and a basic HTML/JavaScript frontend. The app allows users to:
- Get all quotes
- Fetch a random quote
- Add a new quote
- Delete a quote by ID

## Features
- **FastAPI Backend**: Provides APIs to manage quotes (GET, POST, DELETE).
- **In-memory Storage**: Quotes are stored in memory for simplicity.
- **Frontend UI**: Simple HTML/JavaScript-based user interface to interact with the API.

## Installation and Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fastapi-quote-manager.git
cd fastapi-quote-manager
```

### 2. Install Python Dependencies
Make sure you have Python installed. Then, create a virtual environment and install the dependencies.

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment (MacOS/Linux)
source venv/bin/activate

# Activate the virtual environment (Windows)
venv\Scripts\activate

# Install FastAPI and Uvicorn
pip install fastapi uvicorn

# Install optional dependencies (including CORS middleware)
pip install 'fastapi[all]'
```

### 3. Running the FastAPI Server
Start the FastAPI server by running:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

This will start the server at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

### 4. Enabling CORS
CORS is enabled to allow requests from the frontend. The CORS middleware is set to allow requests from any origin (`*`). If you'd like to restrict this, modify the `allow_origins` parameter in the FastAPI setup.

## API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint                | Description                      |
|--------|-------------------------|----------------------------------|
| GET    | `/quotes`               | Get all quotes                   |
| GET    | `/quotes/random`        | Get a random quote               |
| POST   | `/quotes`               | Add a new quote                  |
| DELETE | `/quotes/{id}`          | Delete a quote by ID             |

### Example API Usage

- **Get a random quote:**

```bash
GET http://127.0.0.1:8000/quotes/random
```

Response:
```json
{
    "id": 1,
    "quote": "The only way to do great work is to love what you do.",
    "author": "Steve Jobs"
}
```

- **Add a new quote:**

```bash
POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/quotes
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "quote": "Innovation distinguishes between a leader and a follower.",
    "author": "Steve Jobs"
}
```

- **Delete a quote by ID:**

```bash
DELETE http://127.0.0.1:8000/quotes/1
```

## Frontend UI

The frontend interface allows users to:
- Fetch a random quote
- Add a new quote via a simple form
- Delete a quote by entering the quote ID

### How to Use the Frontend

1. Open `index.html` in a browser.
2. Interact with the buttons:
   - **Random Quote**: Displays a random quote.
   - **Add Quote**: Allows you to add a new quote (inputs required: quote and author).
   - **Delete Quote**: Deletes a quote by entering its ID.

### Frontend Setup

The HTML file is a simple static page that interacts with the FastAPI backend via JavaScript `fetch()` calls. You don't need any extra setup to run the UI locally â€” just open the `index.html` file in your browser after starting the FastAPI server.

### Troubleshooting

- **CORS Issues**: If you get CORS errors when running the app, make sure the FastAPI app has CORS enabled. This is handled via the `CORSMiddleware` in `main.py`.
- **Port Conflicts**: Ensure that no other applications are running on port `8000` before starting the FastAPI server.
- **Cross-Origin Block in Browser**: Make sure you have CORS configured correctly in FastAPI if you're testing the frontend by opening `index.html` locally in your browser.
